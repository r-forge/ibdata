- add (limited) depth-of-book functionality, likely using OrderBook (or whatever works with quantstrat)
- better order functionality
- account / portfolio state monitoring
- reference class accessors (get/set) apparently can be special functions... look into this
- separate client methods and maybe ewrapper methods into separate files by function (requests, internal helpers, etc)
- other request hooks
- add verbose flag to a lot of requests
